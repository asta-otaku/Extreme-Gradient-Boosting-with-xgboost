# Extreme-Gradient-Boosting-with-xgboost
XGBoost is a more regularized form of Gradient Boosting. XGBoost uses advanced regularization (L1 &amp; L2), which improves model generalization capabilities. XGBoost delivers high performance as compared to Gradient Boosting. Its training is very fast and can be parallelized across clusters.
